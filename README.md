# My Personal Website

Welcome to the repository for my personal website, available at [https://matthiasdellago.github.io/](https://matthiasdellago.github.io/). I've created this space to share my work and connect with others in the field.

## What's Inside

Here's a quick rundown of the main files in this repository:

1. `index.html` - This is the heart of the website, where you'll find my profile picture, a brief introduction about myself, and links to my GitHub, blog, email, Google Scholar profile, CV, and LinkedIn.

2. `styles.css` - This file contains all the CSS that makes my website look the way it does.

3. `404.html` - This redirects you to the main page if you try to access a page that doesn't exist on my site.

4. `MatthiasDellagoCV.pdf` - Want to know more about my professional background? Check out my CV.

5. `portrait_white.JPG` - This is the profile picture you'll see on the website.

6. `google696093bb3cb499ff.html` - This is a Google verification file.
